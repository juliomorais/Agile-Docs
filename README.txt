Agile Portfolio (TXT Version)

This repository showcases examples of Agile practices, templates, and tools that I have created or used in my career as a Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Agile Practitioner.

Structure:
- backlog-templates -> Product Backlog samples (Excel, CSV, Markdown)
- dashboards -> Agile metrics dashboards (Burndown, Velocity, OKR tracking)
- bpmn -> BPMN diagrams for business processes
- case-studies -> Agile case studies and documentation
- scripts -> Small SQL/Python scripts for metrics and reporting
- checklists -> DoR, DoD, Agile ceremonies checklists

Purpose:
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my practical experience in Agile frameworks (Scrum, Kanban) and project management by providing reusable artifacts that can add value to teams and organizations.
